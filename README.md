# No End Cities

[![Modrinth](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-end-cities)

This datapack disables end cities (and by extension, end ships) from generating. This is useful if you have a mod or data pack that has custom end cities, or if you just hate end cities for whatever reason.

It does this by replacing the list of biomes that an end city can spawn in with an empty list.
